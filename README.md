# BattleshipsSolitaire
Lightweight logic game written in C and GTK+2

Written in November/December 2014 for a Basics of Programming course at Warsaw University of Technology. Similar to many Battleship Solitaire games, but it's not always possible to solve every puzzle with "pure logic" as diagrams are random, while in most games of this kind diagrams are premade. Has a lot of room for improvements but I'll leave it as it is.
